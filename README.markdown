# Krang

(A charting library built on [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org) and [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com))

## About

Krang wraps around the excellent Raphaël library (a JavaScript vector drawing library using SVG/VML) and handles the ugly details of drawing charts. Supply a dataset, pick a chart type, and you're good to go.

## Status

Krang is under heavy, heavy development. It is nowhere near even _alpha_ status. Don't use it for anything yet. If you're eager to do so, help me make it more robust first.

## Documentation

It does not exist. It might someday. Until then, look in `test/functional` for examples of different chart types.

## License

Just like its dependencies — Prototype and Raphaël — Krang carries the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
